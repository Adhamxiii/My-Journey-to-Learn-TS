# My Journey to Learn TypeScript and React - Lesson 2: Advanced Concepts

In this stage of my learning journey, I delved into advanced TypeScript and React concepts to enhance my skills in building robust and scalable applications. This README outlines the advanced features implemented in the project.

## Project Overview

The project showcases advanced TypeScript and React usage, emphasizing more intricate concepts and techniques.

### 1. **App Component - Handling Form Data with Refs**

The `App` component is the entry point, demonstrating advanced usage of refs to handle and manipulate form data.

#### Key Features:

- Utilization of TypeScript with refs for form handling.
- Clearing the form with `useImperativeHandle` and `forwardRef`.

### 2. **Button Component - Conditional Rendering and Type Safety**

The `Button` component is enhanced for conditional rendering and type-safe props.

#### Key Features:

- Conditional rendering based on the presence of the `href` prop.
- Improved type safety using TypeScript for button and anchor props.

### 3. **Container Component - Generic Components and Props**

The `Container` component showcases the use of generics for creating a flexible, generic container.

#### Key Features:

- Type-safe props with generics.
- Rendering as a specified HTML element or a default `div`.

### 4. **Form Component - Ref Forwarding and Advanced Prop Types**

The `Form` component demonstrates ref forwarding and advanced TypeScript prop types for form handling.

#### Key Features:

- Use of `forwardRef` for ref forwarding to expose the form ref.
- Advanced TypeScript prop types for form events and external manipulation.

### 5. **Input Component - Forwarding Refs for External Manipulation**

The `Input` component utilizes `forwardRef` for forwarding the input ref for external manipulation.

#### Key Features:

- Implementation of `forwardRef` for exposing the input ref.
- Rendering an input field with an associated label.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the application with `npm run dev`.
