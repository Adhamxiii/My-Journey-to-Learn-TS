# My Journey to Learn TypeScript - Lesson 1: Basics

This project is a part of my journey to grasp the fundamentals of TypeScript while building a simple React application for managing course goals. Below, I'll outline the key concepts and lessons learned during the initial stages of this learning process.

## Project Overview

The project is a React application consisting of several components, each serving a specific purpose:

- **App**: The main component orchestrating the application's structure.
- **CourseGoal**: Represents an individual course goal with the ability to delete.
- **CourseGoalList**: Displays a list of course goals, providing feedback based on the number of goals.
- **Header**: Renders a header with an image and a title.
- **InfoBox**: A versatile component for displaying information, warnings, or hints.
- **NewGoal**: Allows users to add new course goals.

## Key Lessons - Basics of TypeScript in React

### 1. **TypeScript Integration in React**

Incorporating TypeScript into a React project for static typing and enhanced code reliability.

### 2. **Type Annotations and Interfaces**

Learning how to use type annotations and interfaces to define the shape of data and props.

### 3. **React Function Components with TypeScript**

Practicing the use of React function components with TypeScript, including defining prop types.

### 4. **State Management with TypeScript**

Understanding TypeScript's role in managing state with React Hooks, particularly with `useState`.

### 5. **Handling Events with TypeScript**

Implementing event handling in React components using TypeScript, ensuring type safety.

### 6. **TypeScript and Refs**

Exploring the use of TypeScript with React refs for handling form submissions.

### 7. **Understanding React Component Props**

Mastering the usage of `PropsWithChildren` type and proper prop structuring for component composition.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the application with `npm run dev`.

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with TypeScript syntax, and continue your journey into the basics of TypeScript in React!
